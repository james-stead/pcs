.SH NAME
pcs_snmp_agent \- a SNMP agent providing data about a corosync/pacemaker cluster

.SH DESCRIPTION
pcs_snmp_agent is a SNMP agent which connects to the master agent (snmpd) via agentx protocol and provides information about a corosync/pacemaker cluster.

.SH SETUP
pcs_snmp_agent doesn't work as a standalone agent. It only provides data to a master agent. To configure a snmpd daemon (from package net\-snmp) as the master agent, add line 'master agentx' into the snmpd configuration file (see snmp.conf(5)). Then master agent has to be configured to accepts requests for pcs defined MIBs. This can be done by adding line 'view systemview included .1.3.6.1.4.1.32723.100' into the snmpd config file.
